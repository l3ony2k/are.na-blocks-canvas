# Are.na Blocks Canvas

A visual tool for exploring Are.na blocks in a canvas interface. This project allows users to interact with Are.na content in a more spatial and intuitive way.

The app uses public browser-side requests against the Are.na API v3 by default. Logging in with an Are.na personal access token unlocks your own (including private) channels.

## Features

- Interactive canvas interface for Are.na blocks
- Drag and drop functionality
- Visual organization of blocks
- Real-time updates with Are.na API v3
- Log in with a personal access token to browse your own and followed channels from the search box (color-coded by visibility)
- Block connections and comments: see every channel a block appears in and surf onward opened channels stack like windows so you never lose your place
- Connect blocks to your own channels (write-scope token) with undo
- Browse any user's channels as a canvas (`@username`), your feed, and random surf
- Flow mode: endless canvas with pinch / ctrl+scroll zoom
- Recently surfed history in the app menu (top-left logo)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
